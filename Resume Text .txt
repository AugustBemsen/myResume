From the moment I produced my first “Hello World” application in the console, I knew I was hooked into the world of development. I thought   myself how to code from courses online, being a developer is not just a job to me, it’s an offered and engaging challenge to continually learn and   improve my skills in creating high-quality apps. What started with a simple “Hello World” has become a full-fledged passion that only gets more exciting every day. Below you’ll find projects I have completed that showcase my skills and general background in developing apps and websites.
